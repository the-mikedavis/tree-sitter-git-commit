# `tree-sitter-git-commit`

> NOTE: This grammar is deprecated in favor of the more featureful [gbprod/tree-sitter-gitcommit](https://github.com/gbprod/tree-sitter-gitcommit). An example change for migrating an editor to the new grammar looks like [this commit](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/commit/44293dfd2248d82f39bb8e5b91cbb1daf2e24290).

A [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) grammar for git commit messages.

### Example
